            <description><![CDATA['Script Tests Reasoning and Creativity of 60+ Models Using Prompts']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A script was created to ask prompts testing reasoning, instruction following, and creativity to around 60 models. The answers were stored in a SQLite database. The prompts covered various topics such as arguing for and against the use of Kubernetes, explaining quantum field theory to a high-school student, and finding the next 20 leap years. The script used a mix of APIs from different platforms. The creator plans to improve the script by using better stop sequences and prompt formatting tailored to each model.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LEGO uses a variety of plastics for their bricks, including CA, HIPS, Bakelite, ABS, SAN, PP, PC, MABS, PA, POM, TP, PE, MTPO, TPU, SEBS, and PET. Each plastic has its own properties and uses, with ABS being the most commonly used since 1963. LEGO is also investing in developing sustainable materials and has already started using plant-sourced polyethylene and phasing out plastic shopping bags.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Austin, the principal software developer of PowerPoint, has passed away at the age of 76. Austin played a significant role in shaping how information is communicated in modern society through the development of PowerPoint. The software, which was released in 1987, revolutionized the creation of slides and became a ubiquitous tool in offices, classrooms, and government agencies. Despite its widespread use, PowerPoint has also faced criticism for its potential to create mind-numbing presentations filled with bullet points. Austin's contributions to the software were instrumental in its success.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comet Nishimura, discovered just a month ago, could be visible to the naked eye this weekend, offering stargazers a rare opportunity. Most comets are discovered months or years before reaching peak visibility, but Nishimura is an exception. It swings by the sun every 437 years and spends most of its time in the outer solar system. The comet will pass closest to the sun on September 17th and will be easiest to observe in the northern hemisphere this Saturday and Sunday. Stargazers can look towards the north-eastern sky before sunrise, to the left of Venus, for the best view.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julia code for calculating the Mandelbrot set is benchmarked against Mojo code. The Julia code takes 7.45 ms to run, while the Mojo code runs in 2.14 ms. Suggestions are made to improve the Julia code, such as using SIMD vectorization and decomposing complex numbers. The @simd macro is limited and cannot see through function calls. Differences between the Julia and Mojo code, such as the use of FP ranges, may also affect performance. Overall, the goal is to optimize the Julia code and potentially surpass the performance of the Mojo code.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telescript is an agent-oriented programming language developed by General Magic as part of the Magic Cap system. It allowed end-user devices to upload programs to servers and take advantage of their capabilities. However, General Magic failed to find a niche in the market and Telescript services were eventually deprecated. The language was object-oriented and used a modified C-like syntax. It introduced the concepts of agents and places, which interacted with each other to perform tasks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google's Privacy Sandbox for the Web has reached 'general availability' on Chrome, marking a significant step towards a more private web. The initiative, introduced in 2019, aims to improve privacy while still providing businesses with necessary tools. The general availability of Privacy Sandbox APIs allows advertising providers and developers to scale the usage of these technologies. Additionally, new ad privacy controls have been rolled out in Chrome, giving users more control over how Privacy Sandbox technologies are used to deliver ads.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Creative Class, consisting of creators, curators, critics, and hangers-on, has a distinct aesthetic that blends businesswear with vintage, sports wear, and work wear. They treat their job as leisure and their leisure as job, reflecting a cool, nonchalant, versatile, durable, and comfortable style. The Creative Class accumulates cultural capital by commenting, repurposing, and reinterpreting past and present culture, creating something modern and new while maintaining familiarity. They play a critical role in the modern economy by directing consumers' time, attention, and money towards aspirational things, places, and ideas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spot It!, the popular family card game, is based on complex mathematics. The game's structure, where every card has one matching symbol with any other card, is rooted in the logic puzzles of 19th-century mathematicians. The game's origins can be traced back to the Reverend Thomas Penyngton Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem, a question of combinatorics. The general solution to this problem was not figured out until 1968, and it has since found applications in various fields, including card games like Spot It!

            <description><![CDATA[FTC Judge Rules Intuit Must Stop Advertising TurboTax as 'Free']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intuit, the company behind TurboTax, has been ruled by a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) judge to have violated US law with deceptive advertising. The judge stated that Intuit must stop promoting TurboTax as 'free' unless all conditions of the free offer are clearly displayed to consumers. Intuit plans to appeal the decision and criticized the FTC's 'predetermined decision.' The ruling comes after the FTC filed an administrative complaint against Intuit in March 2022. If the ruling survives appeal, the order will be in effect for 20 years. Intuit has already agreed to pay $141 million in restitution to consumers in a separate case involving all 50 US states and the District of Columbia.
