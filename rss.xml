            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julia code for calculating the Mandelbrot set is benchmarked against Mojo code. The Julia code takes 7.45 ms to run, while the Mojo code runs in 2.14 ms. Suggestions are made to improve the Julia code, such as using SIMD vectorization and decomposing complex numbers. The @simd macro is limited and cannot see through function calls. Differences between the Julia and Mojo code, such as the use of FP ranges, may also affect performance. Overall, the goal is to optimize the Julia code and potentially surpass the performance of the Mojo code.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comet Nishimura, discovered just a month ago, could be visible to the naked eye this weekend, offering stargazers a rare opportunity. Most comets are discovered months or years before reaching peak visibility, but Nishimura is an exception. It swings by the sun every 437 years and spends most of its time in the outer solar system. The comet will pass closest to the sun on September 17th and will be easiest to observe in the northern hemisphere this Saturday and Sunday. Stargazers can look towards the north-eastern sky before sunrise, to the left of Venus, for the best view.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spot It!, the popular family card game, is based on complex mathematics. The game's structure, where every card has one matching symbol with any other card, is rooted in the logic puzzles of 19th-century mathematicians. The game's origins can be traced back to the Reverend Thomas Penyngton Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem, a question of combinatorics. The general solution to this problem was not figured out until 1968, and it has since found applications in various fields, including card games like Spot It!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decoding GNU coreutils is a long-term project that aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the design and implementation of the command-line utilities in version 8.3. It is a valuable resource for novice programmers looking to explore the inner workings of these utilities. The project is divided into phases, with the first two phases already completed, focusing on providing an overview of each utility and discussing important design decisions. The project also covers the basic design patterns shared by most utilities, such as utility initialization, parsing with Getopt, traversing the file system with fts, and using syscall wrappers and helpers. The coreutils codebase is characterized by its simplicity, use of macros, and reliance on POSIX standards. Overall, this project offers valuable insights into the GNU coreutils and their implementation.

Austin played a significant role in shaping how information is communicated in modern society through the development of PowerPoint. The software, which was released in 1987, revolutionized the creation of slides and became a ubiquitous tool in offices, classrooms, and government agencies. Despite its widespread use, PowerPoint has also faced criticism for its potential to create mind-numbing presentations filled with bullet points. Austin's contributions to the software were instrumental in its success.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security experts believe that hackers have successfully cracked open some of the stolen LastPass vaults, leading to a series of cryptocurrency heists targeting security-conscious individuals. The victims, who were all longtime cryptocurrency investors, had one common factor: they had previously used LastPass to store their 'seed phrase,' the private key needed to access their cryptocurrency investments. The stolen funds were moved to the same blockchain addresses, allowing researchers to link the thefts and identify over 150 victims who lost more than $35 million in crypto. LastPass declined to comment on the research.

The system supports very little hardware other than the text-mode CGA device, serial port, PS/2 keyboard controller, and PCIe AHCI SATA storage devices. The xv6 README provides more information on provenance and intended use.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Creative Class, consisting of creators, curators, critics, and hangers-on, has a distinct aesthetic that blends businesswear with vintage, sports wear, and work wear. They treat their job as leisure and their leisure as job, reflecting a cool, nonchalant, versatile, durable, and comfortable style. The Creative Class accumulates cultural capital by commenting, repurposing, and reinterpreting past and present culture, creating something modern and new while maintaining familiarity. They play a critical role in the modern economy by directing consumers' time, attention, and money towards aspirational things, places, and ideas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burakumin refers to ethnic Japanese people who are believed to be descended from pre-Meiji castes associated with defilement. These occupations acquired a hereditary status of untouchability during Japan's feudal era. After the caste system was abolished, the term burakumin came into use to refer to former caste members and their descendants who continued to face discrimination. The article explores the historical origins, social issues, and discrimination faced by the burakumin community in Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article discusses the performance optimization of Ruby code by comparing it with C extensions. It presents a benchmark test of parsing GraphQL queries using the GraphQL Ruby gem and the Racc C extension. The results show that YJIT, a just-in-time compiler, can outperform the C extension when used with the pure Ruby implementation of Racc. The article also introduces TinyGQL, a pure Ruby GraphQL parser, which achieves faster performance than the C extension when combined with YJIT.

            <description><![CDATA[SoftGPU: Software and Hardware Accelerated Drivers for Windows 9x Virtual Machines]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SoftGPU is a compilation of four projects that provide software and hardware accelerated drivers for Windows 9x virtual machines. It requires a virtual machine with VGA adapter support and Windows 95/98/Me as the guest system. The compilation includes the necessary DirectX versions, Visual C runtime, and OpenGL 95. SoftGPU offers three render drivers: softpipe, llvmlipe, and SVGA3D. The performance of these renderers varies, with SVGA3D providing the highest expected FPS. The hypervisor translation to real hardware GPU is also discussed. The installation process and system requirements are outlined, along with instructions for setting up a VirtualBox VM with hardware acceleration. The article concludes with information on running DirectX tests and optimizing performance for newer CPUs.

            <description><![CDATA[FTC Judge Rules Intuit Must Stop Advertising TurboTax as 'Free']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intuit, the company behind TurboTax, has been ruled by a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) judge to have violated US law with deceptive advertising. The judge stated that Intuit must stop promoting TurboTax as 'free' unless all conditions of the free offer are clearly displayed to consumers. Intuit plans to appeal the decision and criticized the FTC's 'predetermined decision.' The ruling comes after the FTC filed an administrative complaint against Intuit in March 2022. If the ruling survives appeal, the order will be in effect for 20 years. Intuit has already agreed to pay $141 million in restitution to consumers in a separate case involving all 50 US states and the District of Columbia.

            <description><![CDATA[Cisco Systems' Financialization and its Impact on the US Technology Industry]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cisco Systems, once a global leader in telecommunication systems and the Internet, has fallen behind global competitors in critical technologies such as 5G and Internet of Things (IoT). This is due to the company's shift from innovation to financialization, prioritizing stock buybacks to boost its stock price instead of investing in cutting-edge communication-infrastructure products. Since 2001, Cisco has spent $152.3 billion on stock buybacks, wasting funds that could have been used for innovation. The company's turn from innovation to financialization has implications for the competitive position of the US information-and-communication-technology industry. This article provides an in-depth analysis of Cisco's organizational failure and its impact on the US technology industry.
