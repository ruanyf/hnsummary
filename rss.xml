            <description><![CDATA[Decoding the GNU coreutils: Exploring the Design of Command-Line Utilities]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decoding the GNU coreutils version 8.3 is a long-term project aimed at providing useful background for novice programmers exploring the design of command-line utilities. The project is divided into phases, with Phase 1 and Phase 2 already complete. Phase 1 focused on discussing the namespace and execution overview of each utility, while Phase 2 expanded on important design decisions and algorithms. The project also aims to provide a line-by-line code walkthrough for each utility in the future. The GNU coreutils, which are small, single-source file programs, have their own unique design patterns and often rely on the Getopt toolset for parsing command line options. The utilities also make use of the fts library for traversing the file system and include syscall wrappers and helpers from the Gnulib project. Overall, the project provides helpful insights into the design and implementation of the GNU coreutils.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at the University of California San Diego have discovered security flaws in the email forwarding process that allow scammers to impersonate high-profile domains. This vulnerability affects tens of thousands of domains, including government organizations, financial service companies, and major news organizations. The researchers found that scammers can send spoofed emails that bypass the safeguards of email providers like Gmail and Outlook, increasing the likelihood of recipients opening malicious attachments or clicking on harmful links. The vulnerabilities arise from the delegation of email infrastructure to third-party providers and the assumption that each organization operates its own mailing infrastructure. While some providers have patched the issues, the researchers recommend disabling open forwarding and implementing stricter validation policies to address the root problem.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>C++20's std::string and std::vector can be marked as constexpr, allowing them to be used in compile-time programming. However, there are two constraints on constexprness: the value cannot depend on runtime input, and certain data cannot flow from compile-time into runtime. The article explains these constraints using examples of stack variables and memory addresses. It also discusses the limitations of constexpr string and vector, such as the inability to escape pointers to their data and the impact of small string optimization (SSO). The intended use of constexpr string and vector is as local variables or return types of constexpr or consteval functions, rather than as constexpr or constinit variables.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cisco Systems, once a global leader in telecommunication systems and the Internet, has fallen behind global competitors in critical technologies such as 5G and IoT. This is due to the company's shift from innovation to financialization, prioritizing stock buybacks over investments in cutting-edge communication-infrastructure products. Since 2001, Cisco has spent $152.3 billion on stock buybacks, wasting funds that could have been used for technological advancements. The company's focus on maximizing shareholder value has hindered its competitive position in the US information-and-communication-technology industry. This article explores Cisco's transformation from an innovative enterprise to a financialized one and discusses the implications for the industry's global competitiveness.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article discusses the challenges and limitations of using async Rust for concurrency. It explains the difference between parallelism and concurrency and how breaking a problem into separate, independent parts can improve performance. The author explores the use of threads and mutex-based concurrency, highlighting the drawbacks and complexities involved. They then introduce the concept of channels as a synchronization mechanism and discuss how many modern languages, including Rust, provide channels in their standard libraries. The article also delves into the unique challenges of async Rust, such as the need to assure the compiler of data safety and the limitations of using Arc for dynamic lifetimes. Overall, the author suggests that while Rust may not be the best tool for massively concurrent, userspace software, it can still be valuable for other projects.

He later shared what he learned with the company and set a new expectation. Despite his experiences, Khosrowshahi underestimated the cost of an Uber ride in New York City.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GitHub has created the Arctic Code Vault, a data repository stored in the Arctic World Archive (AWA) to preserve a snapshot of every active public repository as of 02/02/2020. The AWA is a long-term archival facility located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago. The archive is designed to last 1,000 years and is considered a stable site for preserving humanity's collective knowledge. The 02/02/2020 snapshot, consisting of 21TB of data, was stored on 186 reels of film and transported to the Arctic Code Vault. To recognize contributions, GitHub created the Arctic Code Vault Badge displayed on developers' profiles. The vault contains open source software from millions of developers worldwide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cerabyte, a German storage startup, claims that its ceramic nanolayer-based storage technology will disrupt the storage market by reducing data center storage TCO by 75%. The company plans to introduce CeraMemory cartridges (2025-30) with storage capacities between 10 PB and 100 PB, and CeraTape (2030-35) with up to 1 EB capacity per tape. Cerabyte's technology uses inorganic nanolayers to store information and can read and write data at GB/s class speeds. The company also highlights the durability and longevity of its ceramic storage, claiming that it can last over 5,000 years and withstand extreme temperatures and environments. Cerabyte's presentation at the 2023 Storage Developer Conference is highly anticipated.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guide to Emacs is aimed at computer programmers who want to master the text editor. It acknowledges that the learning curve for Emacs is steep but promises to help users reach the next level of programming in months rather than years. The guide emphasizes self-driven discovery using Emacs' built-in help, debugging facilities, and source code. The author asks for commitment and patience from readers, urging them to give up their favorite IDE's features for at least a month or two. The next section explores why Emacs is worth the effort.

            <description><![CDATA[Fixing Catastrophic Backtracking in Regular Expressions in Python]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fixing catastrophic backtracking in regular expressions in Python by using a non-greedy pattern. The article discusses how a regex pattern with a greedy subpattern can lead to exponential runtime on strings with many newlines, causing the application to become stuck. By making the repeating subpattern non-greedy and adding the re.DOTALL flag to match newlines, the runtime becomes linear instead of exponential. The article provides a comparison of the performance between the problematic regex and the fixed regex using a test script. The results show that the problematic regex performs poorly on long input sequences, while the fixed regex scales much better. The article concludes with a log-log plot illustrating the exponential relationship between input size and execution time for the problematic regex.

            <description><![CDATA[ASMesh: Anonymous and Secure Messaging in Mesh Networks Using Stronger, Anonymous Double Ratchet]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASMesh is a new protocol that provides anonymous and secure messaging in mesh networks. It addresses the limitations of centralized service providers in scenarios like mass protests in censored networks. The protocol is designed to achieve forward and post-compromise security, as well as forward and post-compromise anonymity. It builds on Signal's Double Ratchet protocol and introduces enhancements to ensure strong confidentiality and anonymity under user corruptions. The protocol's security is proven and its performance is evaluated in simulated mesh networks. The paper also includes a proof of concept implementation.
