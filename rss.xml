            <description><![CDATA['YJIT and Pure Ruby Implementation Outperform C Extension in Ruby Performance Optimization']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article discusses the performance optimization of Ruby code by comparing it with C extensions. It presents a benchmark test of parsing GraphQL queries using the GraphQL Ruby gem and the Racc C extension. The results show that YJIT, a just-in-time compiler, can outperform the C extension when used with the pure Ruby implementation of Racc. The article also introduces TinyGQL, a pure Ruby GraphQL parser, which achieves faster performance than the C extension when combined with YJIT.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julia code for calculating the Mandelbrot set is benchmarked against Mojo code. The Julia code takes 7.45 ms to run, while the Mojo code runs in 2.14 ms. Suggestions are made to improve the Julia code, such as using SIMD vectorization and decomposing complex numbers. The @simd macro is limited and cannot see through function calls. Differences between the Julia and Mojo code, such as the use of FP ranges, may also affect performance. Overall, the goal is to optimize the Julia code and potentially surpass the performance of the Mojo code.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comet Nishimura, discovered just a month ago, could be visible to the naked eye this weekend, offering stargazers a rare opportunity. Most comets are discovered months or years before reaching peak visibility, but Nishimura is an exception. It swings by the sun every 437 years and spends most of its time in the outer solar system. The comet will pass closest to the sun on September 17th and will be easiest to observe in the northern hemisphere this Saturday and Sunday. Stargazers can look towards the north-eastern sky before sunrise, to the left of Venus, for the best view.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Email forwarding flaws allow scammers to impersonate high-profile domains, including government organizations, financial service companies, and major news organizations. The vulnerabilities in the email forwarding process bypass the safeguards of email providers like Gmail and Outlook, making it easier for attackers to send spoofed emails containing malware or spyware. The research team discovered that many organizations outsource their email infrastructure to third-party providers, which can be exploited through email forwarding. The vulnerabilities affect a significant number of domains, including state.gov, Mastercard, The Washington Post, and the Associated Press. While some providers have patched the issues, researchers recommend disabling open forwarding and implementing stricter validation policies to enhance email security.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using LD_PRELOAD to manipulate the behavior of applications without modifying their source code or recompiling them is a powerful trick in Linux. This technique allows users to inject custom code into applications transparently, such as modifying the behavior of the random number generator or intercepting file access calls. The blog post provides examples of how LD_PRELOAD can be used to cheat in games, investigate unknown applications by monitoring file I/O and internet access, and even create bullet-time effects in games. The author emphasizes that while this trick can be fun and useful for debugging, it should not be used to bypass security or gain root privileges.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a TypeScript file containing code for a game of life simulation. The code is 203 lines long and has a file size of 7.24 KB. It appears to be a random implementation of the game of life, with various functions and logic for simulating the evolution of cells on a grid. The code includes functions for initializing the grid, updating the grid based on the rules of the game, and rendering the grid. It also includes helper functions for counting the number of live neighbors for each cell and checking if a cell is alive or dead. Overall, this file seems to be a self-contained implementation of the game of life in TypeScript.

            <description><![CDATA[FTC Judge Rules Intuit Must Stop Advertising TurboTax as 'Free']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intuit, the company behind TurboTax, has been ruled by a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) judge to have violated US law with deceptive advertising. The judge stated that Intuit must stop promoting TurboTax as 'free' unless all conditions of the free offer are clearly displayed to consumers. Intuit plans to appeal the decision and criticized the FTC's 'predetermined decision.' The ruling comes after the FTC filed an administrative complaint against Intuit in March 2022. If the ruling survives appeal, the order will be in effect for 20 years. Intuit has already agreed to pay $141 million in restitution to consumers in a separate case involving all 50 US states and the District of Columbia.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article discusses the challenges and limitations of using async Rust for concurrency. It explains the difference between parallelism and concurrency and how breaking a problem into separate, independent parts can improve performance. The author highlights the drawbacks of using threads and mutex-based concurrency, such as race conditions and deadlocks. They introduce the concept of channels as a synchronization mechanism and discuss how many modern languages provide channels in their standard libraries. The article then delves into the complexities of async Rust, including the tension between low-level control and the need for dynamic lifetimes. It concludes by suggesting that Rust may not be the best tool for massively concurrent, userspace software.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cisco Systems, once a global leader in telecommunication systems and the Internet, has fallen behind global competitors in critical technologies such as 5G and Internet of Things (IoT). This is due to the company's shift from innovation to financialization, prioritizing stock buybacks to boost its stock price instead of investing in cutting-edge communication-infrastructure products. Since 2001, Cisco has spent $152.3 billion on stock buybacks, wasting funds that could have been used for innovation. The company's turn from innovation to financialization has implications for the competitive position of the US information-and-communication-technology industry. This article provides an in-depth analysis of Cisco's organizational failure and its impact on the US technology industry.

            <description><![CDATA[Understanding the Constraints of C++20's constexpr std::string and std::vector]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>C++20's std::string and std::vector can be marked as constexpr, allowing them to be used in compile-time programming. However, there are two constraints on constexprness: the value cannot depend on any runtime input, and certain data cannot flow from compile-time into runtime. The article explains these constraints in detail and provides examples. It also discusses the subtleties of using string and vector in constexpr, such as the impact of small string optimization (SSO) and pointers to self. The article concludes that while constexpr string and vector can be used, it is generally recommended to use them as local variables or return types of constexpr or consteval functions rather than as constexpr or constinit variables.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GitHub has created the Arctic Code Vault, a data repository stored in the Arctic World Archive (AWA) to preserve a snapshot of every active public repository as of 02/02/2020. The AWA is located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, known for its stability and remoteness. The archive is expected to last 1,000 years due to the permafrost and the mine's proximity to the Global Seed Vault. The 02/02/2020 snapshot, consisting of 21TB of data, was stored on 186 reels of film and transported to the Arctic Code Vault. To recognize contributors, GitHub designed the Arctic Code Vault Badge displayed on developers' profiles.
