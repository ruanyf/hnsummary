            <description><![CDATA['Script Tests Reasoning and Creativity of 60+ Models Using Prompts']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A script was created to ask prompts testing reasoning, instruction following, and creativity to around 60 models. The answers were stored in a SQLite database. The prompts covered various topics such as arguing for and against the use of Kubernetes, explaining quantum field theory to a high-school student, and finding the next 20 leap years. The script used a mix of APIs from different platforms. The creator plans to improve the script by using better stop sequences and prompt formatting tailored to each model.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The M1 Garand, considered the best battle rifle of World War II, had a significant impact on subsequent US rifle development. While it provided advantages such as increased rate of fire and improved accuracy, it missed the opportunity to become a modern assault rifle. The US did not field its first true assault rifle until two decades after the concept was invented by the Germans. The article explores the development of the M1 Garand and the factors that influenced its design.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investors accounted for 30% of home purchases in Canada in the first quarter of this year, up from 28% in the same period last year, according to data from the Bank of Canada. Meanwhile, the percentage of first-time homebuyers decreased to 43% from 48% in the same period. The data highlights the growing influence of investors in the Canadian housing market, which can amplify house price cycles. The central bank's data also reveal increasing vulnerabilities in the Canadian economy, including rising delinquencies for car loans and instalment loans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Austin, the principal software developer of PowerPoint, has passed away at the age of 76. Austin played a significant role in shaping how information is communicated in modern society through the development of PowerPoint. The software, which was released in 1987, revolutionized the creation of slides and became a ubiquitous tool in offices, classrooms, and government agencies. Despite its widespread use, PowerPoint has also faced criticism for its potential to create mind-numbing presentations filled with bullet points. Austin's contributions to the software were instrumental in its success.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comet Nishimura, discovered just a month ago, could be visible to the naked eye this weekend, offering stargazers a rare opportunity. Most comets are discovered months or years before reaching peak visibility, but Nishimura is an exception. It swings by the sun every 437 years and spends most of its time in the outer solar system. The comet will pass closest to the sun on September 17th and will be easiest to observe in the northern hemisphere this Saturday and Sunday. Stargazers can look towards the north-eastern sky before sunrise, to the left of Venus, for the best view.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telescript is an agent-oriented programming language developed by General Magic as part of the Magic Cap system. It allowed end-user devices to upload programs to servers and take advantage of their capabilities. However, General Magic failed to find a niche in the market and Telescript services were eventually deprecated. The language was object-oriented and used a modified C-like syntax. It introduced the concepts of agents and places, which interacted with each other to perform tasks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google's Privacy Sandbox for the Web has reached 'general availability' on Chrome, marking a significant step towards a more private web. The initiative, introduced in 2019, aims to improve privacy while still providing businesses with necessary tools. The general availability of Privacy Sandbox APIs allows advertising providers and developers to scale the usage of these technologies. Additionally, new ad privacy controls have been rolled out in Chrome, giving users more control over how Privacy Sandbox technologies are used to deliver ads.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julia code for calculating the Mandelbrot set is benchmarked against Mojo code. The Julia code takes 7.45 ms to run, while the Mojo code runs in 2.14 ms. Suggestions are made to improve the Julia code, such as using SIMD vectorization and decomposing complex numbers. The @simd macro is limited and cannot see through function calls. Differences between the Julia and Mojo code, such as the use of FP ranges, may also affect performance. Overall, the goal is to optimize the Julia code and potentially surpass the performance of the Mojo code.
