            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>iPadOS 17 now supports UVC (USB Video Class) devices, allowing iPads to recognize external webcams, cameras, and other devices connected over USB-C. Federico Viticci tested this feature and found that he could use a Game Boy Camera as his iPad Pro's webcam during FaceTime calls. He also experimented with using a game capture card to play Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck games on his iPad's display. This unexpected functionality showcases the versatility of iPadOS 17 and its potential for creative and gaming applications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A script was created to ask prompts testing reasoning, instruction following, and creativity to around 60 models. The answers were stored in a SQLite database. The prompts covered various topics such as arguing for and against the use of Kubernetes, explaining quantum field theory to a high-school student, and finding the next 20 leap years. The script used a mix of APIs from different platforms. The creator plans to improve the script by using better stop sequences and prompt formatting tailored to each model.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists from Ames National Laboratory have developed a machine learning model that can predict the Curie temperature of new material combinations, a crucial factor in designing permanent magnet materials. This model is a significant step towards using artificial intelligence to discover new magnetic materials without critical elements like cobalt and rare earth elements. The team trained the model using experimental data and theoretical modeling, saving time and resources compared to traditional experimentation. The success of the model in predicting the Curie temperature of material candidates shows promise for designing new permanent magnets for various technological applications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humans possess a unique ability to recognize and remember sequential information, according to a study. Bonobos, our closest relatives, struggle to learn the order of stimuli in the same way as humans. This finding sheds light on the cognitive distinctions between humans and other animals, explaining why only humans possess certain cultural abilities like language and advanced planning. Sequential memory may be the foundational block behind many uniquely human behaviors and capabilities.

This article explores the phenomenon of Bettymania and how it was carefully orchestrated through paid critics, merchandise, and strategic audience placement. While some critics saw it as a national embarrassment, Betty's fame and fee skyrocketed, but he eventually faded from the public eye. This story sheds light on the early history of celebrity culture and the fleeting nature of child stardom.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Austin, the principal software developer of PowerPoint, has passed away at the age of 76. Austin played a significant role in shaping how information is communicated in modern society through the development of PowerPoint. The software, which was released in 1987, revolutionized the creation of slides and became a ubiquitous tool in offices, classrooms, and government agencies. Despite its widespread use, PowerPoint has also faced criticism for its potential to create mind-numbing presentations filled with bullet points. Austin's contributions to the software were instrumental in its success.

The fine-tuned Llama model picked up on the user's texting nuances rapidly and accurately replicated common phrases and emoji usage. In a Turing Test with friends, the model fooled 10% of them, with some responses being eerily similar to the user's own. The adaptation of the Llama model offers a fun way to see how well a LLM can mimic your personal texting style.

This theory is based on the idea that all possible states of a complex system already exist, and calculating them is not necessary for them to feel conscious. The author acknowledges that this theory does not negate the existence of choice and plans to explore community in NYC in future posts.

            <description><![CDATA['Why you might actually want async in your project']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author argues that the sentiment in the Rust community that async/await is only useful for a small number of programs is misguided. They believe that actively shying away from async is the wrong approach and that many Rust projects are already using async/await without realizing it. The author also addresses the reasons why some people may not like async, such as poor advertising and standard library support. They conclude by encouraging Rustaceans to embrace async/await and explore its benefits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian housing prices have continued to rise at an alarming rate, with a 142% increase since 2005 on a real basis. This is in stark contrast to the U.S. housing market, which has seen a more modest 26% increase over the same period. The differences between the two markets become even more pronounced when comparing housing price gains to disposable income gains. While U.S. incomes have kept pace with housing prices, Canadian incomes have not, leading to a significant affordability issue in Canada.
