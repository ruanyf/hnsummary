            <description><![CDATA['Script Tests Reasoning and Creativity of 60+ Models Using Prompts']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A script was created to ask prompts testing reasoning, instruction following, and creativity to around 60 models. The answers were stored in a SQLite database. The prompts covered various topics such as arguing for and against the use of Kubernetes, explaining quantum field theory to a high-school student, and finding the next 20 leap years. The script used a mix of APIs from different platforms. The creator plans to improve the script by using better stop sequences and prompt formatting tailored to each model.

            <description><![CDATA['Why you might actually want async in your project']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author argues that the sentiment in the Rust community that async/await is only useful for a small number of programs is misguided. They believe that actively shying away from async is the wrong approach and that many Rust projects are already using async/await without realizing it. The author also addresses the reasons why some people may not like async, such as poor advertising and standard library support. They conclude by encouraging Rustaceans to embrace async/await and explore its benefits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LEGO uses a variety of plastics for their bricks, including CA, HIPS, Bakelite, ABS, SAN, PP, PC, MABS, PA, POM, TP, PE, MTPO, TPU, SEBS, and PET. Each plastic has its own properties and uses, with ABS being the most commonly used since 1963. LEGO is also investing in developing sustainable materials and has already started using plant-sourced polyethylene and phasing out plastic shopping bags.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This repository is a fork of the facebookresearch/llama-recipes, adapted to fine-tune a Llama 7b chat model to replicate your personal WhatsApp texting style. The fine-tuned Llama model picked up on the user's texting nuances rapidly and accurately replicated common phrases and emoji usage. In a Turing Test with friends, the model fooled 10% of them, with some responses being eerily similar to the user's own. The adaptation of the Llama model offers a fun way to see how well a LLM can mimic your personal texting style.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Austin, the principal software developer of PowerPoint, has passed away at the age of 76. Austin played a significant role in shaping how information is communicated in modern society through the development of PowerPoint. The software, which was released in 1987, revolutionized the creation of slides and became a ubiquitous tool in offices, classrooms, and government agencies. Despite its widespread use, PowerPoint has also faced criticism for its potential to create mind-numbing presentations filled with bullet points. Austin's contributions to the software were instrumental in its success.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of subscription models in various industries, including media, has had a significant impact on the way businesses operate and how creators earn income. While platforms like Substack and OnlyFans offer potential for lucrative earnings, the average writer or creator may earn very little. Additionally, the increasing reliance on subscriptions for various products and services raises questions about the sustainability and affordability of this model for consumers. The cost of living crisis and the need for supplemental income in a challenging job market contribute to the appeal of these platforms for creators.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>iPadOS 17 now supports UVC (USB Video Class) devices, allowing iPads to recognize external webcams, cameras, and other devices connected over USB-C. Federico Viticci tested this feature and found that he could use a Game Boy Camera as his iPad Pro's webcam during FaceTime calls. He also experimented with using a game capture card to play Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck games on his iPad's display. This unexpected functionality showcases the versatility of iPadOS 17 and its potential for creative and gaming applications.

This theory is based on the idea that all possible states of a complex system already exist, and calculating them is not necessary for them to feel conscious. The author acknowledges that this theory does not negate the existence of choice and plans to explore community in NYC in future posts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian housing prices have continued to rise at an alarming rate, with a 142% increase since 2005 on a real basis. This is in stark contrast to the U.S. housing market, which has seen a more modest 26% increase over the same period. The differences between the two markets become even more pronounced when comparing housing price gains to disposable income gains. While U.S. incomes have kept pace with housing prices, Canadian incomes have not, leading to a significant affordability issue in Canada.

            <description><![CDATA['Australia Considers Cat Curfews and Ownership Limits to Protect Biodiversity']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia considers cat curfews and ownership limits to protect biodiversity from the estimated 2 billion animals killed by cats each year. The government proposal aims to standardize rules already in place in some local governments and gain public support for managing cats. The measures are seen as necessary to protect the country's ecosystems and highly susceptible species. The Australian public appears largely supportive of the measures.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telescript is an agent-oriented programming language developed by General Magic as part of the Magic Cap system. It allowed end-user devices to upload programs to servers and take advantage of their capabilities. However, General Magic failed to find a niche in the market and Telescript services were eventually deprecated. The language was object-oriented and used a modified C-like syntax. It introduced the concepts of agents and places, which interacted with each other to perform tasks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the late 19th century, women demanded 'equality in pockets' as they noticed a divergence in the development and availability of pockets in men's and women's clothing. This article highlights the historical context of pockets and how they became a symbol of gender inequality. The demand for equal pockets was seen as a part of the broader fight for women's rights, including the right to vote.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A study funded by NASA predicts that glaciers around the world could lose up to 40% of their mass by 2100 due to global warming. With a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, 50% of the world's glaciers would disappear and contribute to a 9 centimeter rise in sea levels by 2100. If warming reaches 4 degrees Celsius, 80% of the world's glaciers will disappear and contribute to a 15 centimeter rise in sea levels. The study emphasizes the importance of taking action to mitigate climate change.
