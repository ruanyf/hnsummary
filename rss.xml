            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>C++20's std::string and std::vector can be marked as constexpr, allowing them to be used in compile-time programming. However, there are two constraints on constexprness: the value cannot depend on runtime input, and certain data cannot flow from compile-time into runtime. The article explains these constraints using examples of stack variables and memory addresses. It also discusses the limitations of constexpr string and vector, such as the inability to escape pointers to their data and the impact of small string optimization (SSO). The intended use of constexpr string and vector is as local variables or return types of constexpr or consteval functions, rather than as constexpr or constinit variables.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CVE-2023-4809: FreeBSD pf bypass vulnerability allows attackers to bypass rules in pf-based IPv6 firewalls. The vulnerability occurs when a non-compliant IPv6 atomic fragment is sent, containing multiple IPv6 fragmentation headers. FreeBSD handles these fragments by rebuilding the original packet but fails to apply any rules that apply to layers four and higher. As a result, the fragment bypasses the firewall and establishes two-way communication between the attacker and the victim. The vulnerability affects all FreeBSD versions up to 13.2-STABLE and 12.4-STABLE. The solution is to update FreeBSD to the latest version.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Safety Inspector Fired For Finding 'Too Many Defects' Could Cost Railroad Millions. Former track inspector Don Sanders reveals a culture of ignoring safety in favor of profit at Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF). Sanders had previously sued BNSF in 2017 for retaliation after reporting numerous defects. BNSF has a history of destroying evidence and retaliating against employees. Secretly recorded phone calls from the lawsuit expose BNSF's disregard for safety, with employees questioning why defects aren't fixed and supervisors discouraging calls to the Federal Railroad Administration. Other track inspectors confirm the pressure to overlook defects and the consequences of reporting them. Despite the evidence, Sanders' supervisor still has his job, received a raise, and a bonus.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The article discusses the challenges and limitations of using async Rust for concurrency. It explains the difference between parallelism and concurrency and how breaking a problem into separate, independent parts can improve performance. The author explores the use of threads and mutex-based concurrency, highlighting the drawbacks and complexities involved. They then introduce the concept of channels as a synchronization mechanism and discuss how many modern languages, including Rust, provide channels in their standard libraries. The article also delves into the unique challenges of async Rust, such as the need to assure the compiler of data safety and the limitations of using Arc for dynamic lifetimes. Overall, the author suggests that while Rust may not be the best tool for massively concurrent, userspace software, it can still be valuable for other projects.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air pollution degrades the scent of flowers, making it difficult for bees to find them, according to a study by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and several universities. The research found that ground-level ozone, formed when nitrogen oxide emissions react with volatile organic compounds, changes the size and scent of floral odour plumes. This reduced honeybees' ability to recognise odours by up to 90% from just a few metres away. The study suggests that ozone could have a negative impact on wildflower abundance and crop yields, with implications for food security. The research highlights the need to take action on air pollution to protect pollinators and preserve biodiversity.

            <description><![CDATA[Ancient Chinese water pipes reveal neolithic communities' engineering capabilities without centralized authority]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ancient ceramic water pipes discovered in China reveal that neolithic communities were capable of complex engineering without a centralized state authority, according to a study by University College London. The network of pipes and drainage ditches at the site of Pingliangtai, dating back 4,000 years, demonstrates communal cooperation in building and maintaining the system. The settlement shows little evidence of social hierarchy, with uniformly small houses and no signs of significant inequality. The discovery challenges the belief that only centralized states could undertake such engineering feats, highlighting the capabilities of more egalitarian and communal societies. The advanced water management system at Pingliangtai required significant community-wide planning and coordination.

            <description><![CDATA[ASMesh: Anonymous and Secure Messaging in Mesh Networks Using Stronger, Anonymous Double Ratchet]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASMesh is a new protocol that provides anonymous and secure messaging in mesh networks. It addresses the limitations of centralized service providers in scenarios like mass protests in censored networks. The protocol is designed to achieve forward and post-compromise security, as well as forward and post-compromise anonymity. It builds on Signal's Double Ratchet protocol and introduces enhancements to ensure strong confidentiality and anonymity under user corruptions. The protocol's security is proven and its performance is evaluated in simulated mesh networks. The paper also includes a proof of concept implementation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FTC judge rules that Intuit's 'free' TurboTax ads were misleading, finding that the company deceived consumers by advertising its tax filing service as free when users had to pay to use it. The ruling includes evidence of commercials and online ads promoting the 'Free Edition' software. Intuit was also criticized for making its actually free Free File version difficult to find. The judge issued a cease-and-desist order, prohibiting Intuit from engaging in deceptive practices and requiring clear disclosure of any terms that would limit offers. Intuit responded by calling the investigation process flawed and questionable, stating that it already adheres to most advertising practices in the FTC's decision. The IRS is working on a government-backed free filing service for the 2024 tax season.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft signs one of the biggest carbon removal deals to date with Heirloom Carbon, a startup that uses crushed rocks to absorb CO2 from the air. The deal involves capturing 315,000 metric tons of carbon over 10 years, equivalent to 75% of Microsoft's 2022 emissions. Heirloom's method involves heating limestone in an electric kiln to release CO2, then spreading the leftover calcium oxide on trays to absorb carbon from the air. The deal signifies confidence in Heirloom's approach and supports Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030. This type of long-term contract is similar to power purchase agreements in the renewable energy sector.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX must address multiple issues and apply for a modified FAA license before launching its Starship mega rocket again, following its failed debut that ended in an explosion. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has closed its investigation into the incident and has identified 63 corrective actions for SpaceX to take. The April launch explosion resulted in debris being scattered for thousands of feet and a plume of pulverized concrete spreading for miles. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has made improvements to the rocket and launch pad, and a new Starship is ready for liftoff. NASA plans to use Starship for moon landings, while Musk aims to build a fleet for Mars missions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Specialized astrocytes in the central nervous system mediate glutamatergic gliotransmission, playing a role in brain circuitry assembly and function. Through the use of molecular, bioinformatic, and imaging approaches, researchers identified a subpopulation of astrocytes in the hippocampus that selectively expressed synaptic-like glutamate-release machinery. These astrocytes were found to respond to astrocyte-selective stimulations with subsecond glutamate release events at specific locations. Deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in these astrocytes suppressed the glutamate release. The study provides insights into the complex roles of astrocytes in the central nervous system and identifies a potential therapeutic target.

            <description><![CDATA[Understanding the State of Malicious Code in the PyPI Ecosystem]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This empirical study examines the characteristics and current state of malicious code in the PyPI ecosystem. The researchers collected a dataset of 4,669 malicious package files and classified them into five categories based on their behavior. The study found that over 50% of the malicious code exhibited multiple malicious behaviors, with information stealing and command execution being common. The analysis revealed that 74.81% of the malicious packages successfully entered end-user projects through source code installation, posing significant security risks. Furthermore, many reported malicious packages persisted in PyPI mirror servers globally, even after being discovered. The study provides insights into the lifecycle of malicious code in the PyPI ecosystem and suggests mitigations to enhance the security of the Python open-source ecosystem.
