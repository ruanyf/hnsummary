            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aardvark'd: The Fog Creek Documentary, 18 Years Later is a documentary film about Fog Creek's summer internship program in 2005. The film captures interviews with individuals who would go on to achieve fame and success in the tech industry. It explores the indie software scene of 2005, featuring Fog Creek Software, Y Combinator, and the launch of reddit. The documentary showcases the vulnerability and uncertainty experienced by tech startup founders during their early days. Despite its flaws, Aardvark'd provides a relatable and engaging look into the challenges of launching a software product. The film ends without a clear resolution, leaving viewers wondering about the outcome of the interns' project. The documentary includes insightful quotes from Paul Graham and Aaron Swartz. Surprisingly, Fog Creek did not finance the film, and the filmmaker recently uploaded it for free on YouTube.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The paper introduces Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. OPRO uses natural language prompts to generate new solutions in each optimization step. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRO on linear regression, traveling salesman problems, and prompt optimization tasks. They show that prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks. The paper falls under the categories of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Computation and Language.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air pollution degrades the scent of flowers, making it difficult for bees to find them, according to a study by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and several universities. The research found that ground-level ozone, formed when nitrogen oxide emissions react with volatile organic compounds, changes the size and scent of floral odour plumes. This reduced honeybees' ability to recognise odours by up to 90% from just a few metres away. The study suggests that ozone could have a negative impact on wildflower abundance and crop yields, with implications for food security. The research highlights the need to take action on air pollution to protect pollinators and preserve biodiversity.

            <description><![CDATA[Zinc-air batteries identified as cheaper and safer alternative to lithium-ion batteries]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zinc-air batteries have been identified as a cheaper and safer alternative to lithium-ion batteries for powering electric vehicles, according to a study by Edith Cowan University. The research found that zinc-air batteries, which use a combination of sustainable and cost-effective materials, offer improved lifespan and performance compared to lithium-ion batteries. The breakthrough design of these batteries, using new materials such as carbon, iron, and cobalt, has overcome previous limitations related to power output and lifespan. The use of abundant zinc resources in countries like Australia, along with the ubiquity of air, makes zinc-air batteries a viable and reliable energy storage solution. This development contributes to building a sustainable society and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ancient ceramic water pipes discovered in China reveal that neolithic communities were capable of complex engineering without a centralized state authority, according to a study by University College London. The network of pipes and drainage ditches at the site of Pingliangtai, dating back 4,000 years, demonstrates communal cooperation in building and maintaining the system. The settlement shows little evidence of social hierarchy, with uniformly small houses and no signs of significant inequality. The discovery challenges the belief that only centralized states could undertake such engineering feats, highlighting the capabilities of more egalitarian and communal societies. The advanced water management system at Pingliangtai required significant community-wide planning and coordination.

            <description><![CDATA[Understanding the State of Malicious Code in the PyPI Ecosystem]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This empirical study examines the characteristics and current state of malicious code in the PyPI ecosystem. The researchers collected a dataset of 4,669 malicious package files and classified them into five categories based on their behavior. The study found that over 50% of the malicious code exhibited multiple malicious behaviors, with information stealing and command execution being common. The analysis revealed that 74.81% of the malicious packages successfully entered end-user projects through source code installation, posing significant security risks. Furthermore, many reported malicious packages persisted in PyPI mirror servers globally, even after being discovered. The study provides insights into the lifecycle of malicious code in the PyPI ecosystem and suggests mitigations to enhance the security of the Python open-source ecosystem.

            <description><![CDATA[TSMC warns AI chip crunch will last another 18 months]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMC warns that the shortage of advanced packaging capacity will continue to impact the availability of high-end GPUs until at least the end of 2024. The issue lies in the lack of capacity to stitch the silicon together, rather than a shortage of chips. TSMC can only meet about 80% of the demand for its chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology, which is used in advanced chips for AI workloads. TSMC expects additional CoWoS capacity to come online within the next 18 months. This shortage affects not only Nvidia but also AMD's upcoming Instinct MI300-series accelerators.

            <description><![CDATA[Breaking the Hydrogen Barrier: Hydrogen's Potential to Decarbonize Aviation]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hydrogen is presented as the best solution for decarbonizing aviation due to its zero-emissions, safety, economic viability, low-noise profile, and ability to enable new regional air mobility connections. H2FLY, a German developer, has successfully completed the world's first piloted flight of an electric aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen. They have been researching and refining a hydrogen-electric powertrain system for over a decade, and their fuel cell system converts clean hydrogen into electricity to power their demonstrator aircraft HY4. This achievement proves that zero-emission aviation is within reach. H2FLY's vision is to unlock the era of sustainable air travel by developing qualified hydrogen-electric powertrains for aviation.

            <description><![CDATA[IBM to Increase Cloud Costs by Up to 26% in 2024]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IBM plans to increase its cloud services costs by up to 26% in 2024, affecting infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings. The price hike will be steeper for international customers compared to those in the US. PaaS services, including Kubernetes Services and RedHat OpenShift, will see a 3% price increase globally. For IaaS offerings, the price hikes will apply to bare metal servers, virtual server instances, file and block storage, and networking infrastructure. The price changes will vary across different data centers, with some experiencing increases of up to 7.5%. IBM's Cloud Object Storage service will also see price increases of 25% to 26% globally. This move follows similar price hikes by other technology vendors to combat inflation and rising costs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LGBTQ dating app Grindr loses nearly half of its staff after implementing a return-to-office policy. The policy required employees to either relocate to designated 'hub' cities or leave the company. Around 80 out of 178 workers were forced to leave as a result. The return-to-work policy is seen as retaliatory by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in response to a union drive at the company. The CWA has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Grindr. This situation reflects the ongoing tensions between employers and workers regarding return-to-office policies in the post-pandemic era.

The morgue contains millions of newspaper clippings, photographs, and other materials organized by subject matter. The researcher explores the transition from hot metal composition to computer phototypesetting at The Times in the 1970s, delving into the reasons behind the newspaper's delayed adoption of the technology. The visit to the morgue reveals internal publications documenting the transition and photos of the typesetting room. The researcher shares their process of organizing and analyzing the materials for their book on the topic.
