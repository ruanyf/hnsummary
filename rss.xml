            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft signs one of the biggest carbon removal deals to date with Heirloom Carbon, a startup that uses crushed rocks to absorb CO2 from the air. The deal involves capturing 315,000 metric tons of carbon over 10 years, equivalent to 75% of Microsoft's 2022 emissions. Heirloom's method involves heating limestone in an electric kiln to release CO2, then spreading the leftover calcium oxide on trays to absorb carbon from the air. The deal signifies confidence in Heirloom's approach and supports Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030. This type of long-term contract is similar to power purchase agreements in the renewable energy sector.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The paper introduces Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. OPRO uses natural language prompts to generate new solutions in each optimization step. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRO on linear regression, traveling salesman problems, and prompt optimization tasks. They show that prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks. The paper falls under the categories of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Computation and Language.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Air pollution degrades the scent of flowers, making it difficult for bees to find them, according to a study by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and several universities. The research found that ground-level ozone, formed when nitrogen oxide emissions react with volatile organic compounds, changes the size and scent of floral odour plumes. This reduced honeybees' ability to recognise odours by up to 90% from just a few metres away. The study suggests that ozone could have a negative impact on wildflower abundance and crop yields, with implications for food security. The research highlights the need to take action on air pollution to protect pollinators and preserve biodiversity.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is criticized for providing zero practical security due to its flawed architecture and broken implementations. The concept of 'trusted computing' was introduced primarily for DRM and ownership purposes, but it failed to impact the consumer market. However, there is a recent push to reintroduce TPM, with Microsoft requiring TPM 2.0 for Windows 11 and Google exploring its integration into web browsers. Even Canonical is adopting TPM for full-disk encryption in Ubuntu. The TPM is a microcontroller that stores keys, passwords, and certificates, aiming to enhance security. However, the TPM's threat model is flawed, relying on trusting all software running on the system up until the measurement is sealed. This raises concerns about future measurements and the potential for vulnerabilities. Overall, TPM's practical security benefits are questionable.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX must address multiple issues and apply for a modified FAA license before launching its Starship mega rocket again, following its failed debut that ended in an explosion. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has closed its investigation into the incident and has identified 63 corrective actions for SpaceX to take. The April launch explosion resulted in debris being scattered for thousands of feet and a plume of pulverized concrete spreading for miles. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has made improvements to the rocket and launch pad, and a new Starship is ready for liftoff. NASA plans to use Starship for moon landings, while Musk aims to build a fleet for Mars missions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ancient ceramic water pipes discovered in China reveal that neolithic communities were capable of complex engineering without a centralized state authority, according to a study by University College London. The network of pipes and drainage ditches at the site of Pingliangtai, dating back 4,000 years, demonstrates communal cooperation in building and maintaining the system. The settlement shows little evidence of social hierarchy, with uniformly small houses and no signs of significant inequality. The discovery challenges the belief that only centralized states could undertake such engineering feats, highlighting the capabilities of more egalitarian and communal societies. The advanced water management system at Pingliangtai required significant community-wide planning and coordination.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT, the popular chatbot developed by OpenAI, is experiencing a decline in website traffic and user engagement for the third consecutive month. The average time spent on the chatbot has decreased, and while the decline in visits seems to be stabilizing, it may be attributed to the summer break for students. Additionally, academics have found that ChatGPT's accuracy has diminished over time. Despite its initial popularity, the chatbot's performance has raised concerns among users, with complaints about its declining performance. OpenAI has not yet responded to these concerns.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Specialized astrocytes in the central nervous system mediate glutamatergic gliotransmission, playing a role in brain circuitry assembly and function. Through the use of molecular, bioinformatic, and imaging approaches, researchers identified a subpopulation of astrocytes in the hippocampus that selectively expressed synaptic-like glutamate-release machinery. These astrocytes were found to respond to astrocyte-selective stimulations with subsecond glutamate release events at specific locations. Deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in these astrocytes suppressed the glutamate release. The study provides insights into the complex roles of astrocytes in the central nervous system and identifies a potential therapeutic target.

            <description><![CDATA[Understanding the State of Malicious Code in the PyPI Ecosystem]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This empirical study examines the characteristics and current state of malicious code in the PyPI ecosystem. The researchers collected a dataset of 4,669 malicious package files and classified them into five categories based on their behavior. The study found that over 50% of the malicious code exhibited multiple malicious behaviors, with information stealing and command execution being common. The analysis revealed that 74.81% of the malicious packages successfully entered end-user projects through source code installation, posing significant security risks. Furthermore, many reported malicious packages persisted in PyPI mirror servers globally, even after being discovered. The study provides insights into the lifecycle of malicious code in the PyPI ecosystem and suggests mitigations to enhance the security of the Python open-source ecosystem.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TSMC warns that the shortage of advanced packaging capacity will continue to impact the availability of high-end GPUs until at least the end of 2024. The issue lies in the lack of capacity to stitch the silicon together, rather than a shortage of chips. TSMC can only meet about 80% of the demand for its chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology, which is used in advanced chips for AI workloads. TSMC expects additional CoWoS capacity to come online within the next 18 months. This shortage affects not only Nvidia but also AMD's upcoming Instinct MI300-series accelerators.
