            <description><![CDATA['Script Tests Reasoning and Creativity of 60+ Models Using Prompts']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A script was created to ask prompts testing reasoning, instruction following, and creativity to around 60 models. The answers were stored in a SQLite database. The prompts covered various topics such as arguing for and against the use of Kubernetes, explaining quantum field theory to a high-school student, and finding the next 20 leap years. The script used a mix of APIs from different platforms. The creator plans to improve the script by using better stop sequences and prompt formatting tailored to each model.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of subscription models in various industries, including media, has had a significant impact on the way businesses operate and how creators earn income. While platforms like Substack and OnlyFans offer potential for lucrative earnings, the average writer or creator may earn very little. Additionally, the increasing reliance on subscriptions for various products and services raises questions about the sustainability and affordability of this model for consumers. The cost of living crisis and the need for supplemental income in a challenging job market contribute to the appeal of these platforms for creators.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Department of Energy has provided a $400 million loan to battery maker Eos Energy, which offers zinc-halide batteries as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Eos hopes that its zinc-based technology can store renewable energy at a lower cost than lithium-ion batteries. The loan is the first of its kind from the DOE's Loan Program Office to a battery maker focused on alternatives to lithium-ion cells. The funding will support the expansion of Eos's manufacturing capacity.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lab-grown meat is unlikely to be a viable solution for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming. While it offers the allure of reducing emissions while still enjoying meat, the technology faces significant challenges in scaling up production and may not even work at the proposed scale. Additionally, there are already existing alternatives, such as policy measures and market-driven changes, that have a better chance of achieving emission reductions. Lab-grown meat should not be considered a climate solution.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian housing prices have continued to rise at an alarming rate, with a 142% increase since 2005 on a real basis. This is in stark contrast to the U.S. housing market, which has seen a more modest 26% increase over the same period. The differences between the two markets become even more pronounced when comparing housing price gains to disposable income gains. While U.S. incomes have kept pace with housing prices, Canadian incomes have not, leading to a significant affordability issue in Canada.

While it provided advantages such as increased rate of fire and improved accuracy, it missed the opportunity to become a modern assault rifle. The US did not field its first true assault rifle until two decades after the concept was invented by the Germans. The article explores the development of the M1 Garand and the factors that influenced its design.

            <description><![CDATA['Existence in an Un-Simulated Reality: A Theory on the Feeling of Consciousness']]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author proposes a theory that even if a simulation of reality is never run, it would still feel real to the actors inside it. This theory is based on the idea that all possible states of a complex system already exist, and calculating them is not necessary for them to feel conscious. The author acknowledges that this theory does not negate the existence of choice and plans to explore community in NYC in future posts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Austin, the principal software developer of PowerPoint, has passed away at the age of 76. Austin played a significant role in shaping how information is communicated in modern society through the development of PowerPoint. The software, which was released in 1987, revolutionized the creation of slides and became a ubiquitous tool in offices, classrooms, and government agencies. Despite its widespread use, PowerPoint has also faced criticism for its potential to create mind-numbing presentations filled with bullet points. Austin's contributions to the software were instrumental in its success.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telescript is an agent-oriented programming language developed by General Magic as part of the Magic Cap system. It allowed end-user devices to upload programs to servers and take advantage of their capabilities. However, General Magic failed to find a niche in the market and Telescript services were eventually deprecated. The language was object-oriented and used a modified C-like syntax. It introduced the concepts of agents and places, which interacted with each other to perform tasks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When shifting a register by more than its size, different processor architectures exhibit different behaviors. The table provided in the article shows the behavior of various processors, including the 8086, Alpha AXP, x86-64, MIPS, PowerPC, and more. The article also mentions that the C and C++ languages leave the behavior undefined when shifting by more than the bit width of the shifted type.
