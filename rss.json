The research found that zinc-air batteries, which use a combination of sustainable and cost-effective materials, offer improved lifespan and performance compared to lithium-ion batteries. The breakthrough design of these batteries, using new materials such as carbon, iron, and cobalt, has overcome previous limitations related to power output and lifespan. The use of abundant zinc resources in countries like Australia, along with the ubiquity of air, makes zinc-air batteries a viable and reliable energy storage solution.

The researchers suggest that the absence of clear, identifiable agents behind natural events may lead humans to personify the world around them and attribute these events to supernatural forces.

The research found that ground-level ozone, formed when nitrogen oxide emissions react with volatile organic compounds, changes the size and scent of floral odour plumes. This reduced honeybees' ability to recognise odours by up to 90% from just a few metres away. The study suggests that ozone could have a negative impact on wildflower abundance and crop yields, with implications for food security. The research highlights the need to take action on air pollution to protect pollinators and preserve biodiversity.\n            </p><p>\n                121 Points |  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37434381\">24 comments</a>\n            </p>",
