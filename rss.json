This vulnerability affects tens of thousands of domains, including government organizations, financial service companies, and major news organizations. The researchers found that scammers can send spoofed emails that bypass the safeguards of email providers like Gmail and Outlook, increasing the likelihood of recipients opening malicious attachments or clicking on harmful links. The vulnerabilities arise from the delegation of email infrastructure to third-party providers and the assumption that each organization operates its own mailing infrastructure. While some providers have patched the issues, the researchers recommend disabling open forwarding and implementing stricter validation policies to address the root problem.\n            </p><p>\n                3 Points |  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37438478\">0 comments</a>\n            </p>",

This reduced honeybees' ability to recognise odours by up to 90% from just a few metres away. The study suggests that ozone could have a negative impact on wildflower abundance and crop yields, with implications for food security.
