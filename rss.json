The article presents a benchmark comparing the performance of a pure Ruby implementation of the GraphQL parser with a C extension. It also explores the impact of YJIT optimizations on both implementations. The results show that YJIT can achieve faster speeds than a C extension when used with the pure Ruby implementation. Additionally, a hand-written recursive descent parser in pure Ruby called TinyGQL is introduced and compared to the GraphQL C extension. With YJIT enabled, TinyGQL outperforms the C extension by 30%. These findings suggest that rewriting slow code in pure Ruby can be a viable alternative to using C extensions for performance optimization.\n            </p><p>\n                35 Points |  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37422705\">19 comments</a>\n            </p>",

The vulnerabilities arise from the delegation of email infrastructure to third-party providers and the assumption that each organization operates its own mailing infrastructure. While some providers have patched the issues, the researchers recommend disabling open forwarding and implementing stricter validation policies to address the root problem.\n            </p><p>\n                148 Points |  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37438478\">41 comments</a>\n            </p>",

It explains the difference between parallelism and concurrency and how breaking a problem into separate, independent parts can improve performance. The author explores the use of threads and mutex-based concurrency, highlighting the drawbacks and complexities involved. They then introduce the concept of channels as a synchronization mechanism and discuss how many modern languages, including Rust, provide channels in their standard libraries. The article also delves into the unique challenges of async Rust, such as the need to assure the compiler of data safety and the limitations of using Arc for dynamic lifetimes.
