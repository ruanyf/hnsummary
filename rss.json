The article explains these constraints using examples of stack variables and memory addresses. It also discusses the limitations of constexpr string and vector, such as the inability to escape pointers to their data and the impact of small string optimization (SSO).

The research found that ground-level ozone, formed when nitrogen oxide emissions react with volatile organic compounds, changes the size and scent of floral odour plumes. This reduced honeybees' ability to recognise odours by up to 90% from just a few metres away. The study suggests that ozone could have a negative impact on wildflower abundance and crop yields, with implications for food security. The research highlights the need to take action on air pollution to protect pollinators and preserve biodiversity.\n            </p><p>\n                121 Points |  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37434381\">24 comments</a>\n            </p>",
