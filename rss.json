The estimated 20 to 40 million tonnes of lithium metal could have significant implications for the global lithium market, including price, supply security, and geopolitics. The deposit is composed of an unusual claystone called illite, which contains almost double the amount of lithium compared to the more common lithium-bearing clay mineral, magnesium smectite. Mining is expected to begin in 2026.\n            </p><p>\n                219 Points |  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37450915\">111 comments</a>\n            </p>",
