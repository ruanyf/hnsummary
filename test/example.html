This process involves several steps, including element breakdown, velocity determination, coefficient determination, force buildup, and iterative calculations to simulate flight accurately. Unlike other simulators that rely on stability derivatives, which oversimplify flight dynamics, X-Plane's method allows for a more detailed and realistic representation of how aircraft behave under various conditions. The simulator considers factors like downwash, propwash, and compressible flow effects, providing a comprehensive model that adapts to different flight scenarios. This advanced approach enables users to input an aircraft's geometry and receive accurate predictions of its flight behavior, enhancing the overall simulation experience.</p></div><div class="summary" id="comments-4adce93756e7050d850955475820630c"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43064200" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><b>Comments:</b></a> Comments reflect a mix of curiosity and enthusiasm about flight simulation.

The parser uses a hand-written approach, representing JSON data with a Rust enum called JSONValue, which includes types like string, number, object, array, boolean, and null. It handles parsing errors through a JSONParseError enum, providing detailed error messages with context for debugging. The implementation includes functions for parsing simple values, strings with escape sequences, and numbers, as well as collections like arrays and objects. After testing with benchmark files, the parser achieved a speed of around 52 MB/s, which the student found satisfactory given the lack of performance optimization. The project also included enhancements for error reporting, making it easier to identify issues during parsing. The student expressed confusion over performance differences when running the parser with and without sudo, prompting discussions about potential system resource limits and benchmarking practices.</p></div><div class="summary" id="comments-497c3ce547794e9c0ef911ba0aab1b8e"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43096975" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><b>Comments:</b></a> Commenters discussed various aspects of the JSON parser project, including performance discrepancies when running with sudo, suggesting that resource limits might affect speed.

    <div class="original-title">Original title: Append-Only Programming</div><div class="summary" id="summary-5e12ea251299cc56cddab2aac26cd7b3"><p>Append-only programming is a new methodology that emphasizes defining interfaces before implementations, writing small functions, and creating readable source code that reflects the programmer's thought process. However, it is not forgiving; if an error is found in a subprocedure, a corrected version must be appended, requiring all callers to be updated, which can lead to extensive retyping. The author prefers using shell commands over conventional text editors to enforce the append-only rules, but acknowledges that this approach is more of a fun challenge than a practical software development method. While the idea of incrementally building a program using forward declarations in C is appealing, the reality of coding often involves needing to revise high-level functions mid-development, which complicates the append-only process. Troubleshooting also becomes cumbersome, as it may require retyping entire functions for minor adjustments. Although the experiment with append-only programming was interesting, the author suggests that it may not be worth repeating without modifications to alleviate some of its tedious aspects.</p></div></div>

    <div class="original-title">Original title: Introducing scheme-rs: A Glue Language for Async Rust</div><div class="summary" id="summary-3e4ac8cfbca3dc83604bae17ded86e5c"><p>The blog post introduces scheme-rs, an implementation of R6RS designed to enhance the experience of programming with async Rust. The author, a long-time Rust user, acknowledges the frustrations associated with async Rust, such as slow compile times and difficult debugging, while emphasizing that these issues stem from intentional design trade-offs. Scheme-rs aims to provide a 'glue language' that allows for seamless interoperability with async Rust, enabling developers to define bridge functions and utilize a REPL for debugging. The choice of Scheme is justified by its expressive nature and robust macro system, which the author intends to leverage in a future language called Gouki. Gouki is envisioned as a superset of Scheme with a stronger type system, allowing developers to write most code in Gouki while using Rust for low-level tasks. Although scheme-rs is still a work-in-progress, it currently supports essential features like tail calls and a robust macro system, while lacking some built-ins and error handling. The author has recently transitioned scheme-rs from an interpreter to a compiler to improve performance and aims to complete the R6RS specification soon, inviting contributions from interested developers.</p></div></div>

The MitM attack exploits a flaw where the client fails to properly verify the server's host key when certain error codes are returned, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate server. The DoS vulnerability arises from unlimited memory allocation during the handling of PING and PONG packets, which can lead to resource exhaustion on the client side. While the server has some built-in mitigations, the client lacks protections against this attack. The vulnerabilities were introduced in different versions of OpenSSH, with the MitM issue dating back to 2014 and the DoS issue introduced in 2023. A proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass host key verification and consume system resources.</p></div></div>

However, they have deprecated support for PhysX, a physics simulation tool that was once a significant selling point for Nvidia's hardware. This change has notably impacted older games that relied on PhysX, such as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, which was released in 2013. PhysX originated from a Swedish company, NovodeX, and was later acquired by Ageia, leading to the development of dedicated hardware cards. Nvidia's acquisition of Ageia in 2008 allowed for the integration of PhysX into its GPUs, enabling advanced physics effects in games like Mafia II and Batman: Arkham City. While modern game engines like Unity now handle physics more efficiently, the transition away from PhysX has left some older titles struggling to perform optimally on the latest Nvidia cards.</p></div></div>

A recent study published in Nature details the 3D structure of an ultra-hot Jupiter's atmosphere, highlighting powerful winds that create complex weather patterns. Additionally, a companion study in Astronomy and Astrophysics unexpectedly identified titanium in the atmosphere of this exoplanet. While missions like Kepler and TESS have successfully identified various exoplanets and their orbits, they do not provide insights into the planets' compositions or conditions. Kepler's transit method detects planets by observing dips in starlight as planets pass in front of their host stars, allowing astronomers to infer orbital periods and distances from the stars. This information, combined with the brightness of the host stars, helps estimate the incoming light and potential temperatures of the planets, particularly those in the habitable zone where conditions could support liquid water.</p></div></div>

    <div class="summary" id="summary-f28be01b0b6cf6d5254bc560e9a63a7c"><p>OpenAI is contemplating granting additional voting rights to its nonprofit board to maintain control amid a potential takeover bid from Elon Musk. Reports indicate that CEO Sam Altman and board members are exploring governance changes as OpenAI transitions to a for-profit model. The proposed changes would empower the nonprofit board to override decisions made by investors, including major backers like Microsoft and SoftBank. This move aims to safeguard OpenAI against hostile offers, particularly from Musk, who recently made a $97.4 billion bid for the company. Altman has publicly rejected Musk's offer, labeling him a competitor and asserting that OpenAI is not for sale. He further emphasized the company's commitment to its mission and humorously suggested an alternative deal involving Twitter. The board has unanimously voted against Musk's proposal.</p></div></div>

Typically, about 1,000 employees leave NASA each year, suggesting that many of those resigning may have already planned to exit. The cuts have particularly affected probationary employees, with over 1,000 impacted, as the Trump administration has targeted new hires and those recently promoted. Additionally, agency directors have been instructed to prepare for potential further significant reductions in force, although the specifics remain unclear and depend on upcoming budget negotiations with Congress. This ongoing uncertainty contributes to a demoralized workforce at NASA.</p></div></div>

Research indicates a decline in trust during the pandemic, but recent studies suggest this trend may be reversing, with overall confidence in scientific institutions slightly rebounding. However, a significant divide persists between political factions, with Democrats generally exhibiting higher trust levels compared to Republicans. Experts note that the Trump administration's attacks on science did not have the feared detrimental impact on trust and may have even increased confidence among some groups. The weaponization of scientific topics by political and economic entities has contributed to this mistrust, raising concerns about future implications. Observers are particularly interested in how a potential second Trump term might affect public confidence in science, especially given recent actions that created uncertainty within academic circles.</p></div></div>

It can handle demanding games like Hitman and Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high settings and even runs Cyberpunk 2077 at Ultra settings with decent frame rates when the resolution is adjusted. The device features a 13.4-inch touchscreen display, a solid kickstand, and a webcam that supports Windows Hello. While it has a good keyboard and trackpad, its weight of 2.65 pounds without the keyboard and 3.51 pounds with it makes it one of the heavier options in the tablet market, which can hinder its usability as a portable touchscreen device. Despite its gaming prowess and decent battery life, the Z13's heft may be a drawback for users seeking a lightweight tablet experience.</p></div></div>

One promising option is producing fuel on the Moon, where hydrogen and oxygen are available, and the lower gravity allows for more effective use of produced fuel for deeper space missions. However, establishing the necessary infrastructure for fuel production will likely require significant resources to be transported from Earth. A recent study highlights that producing oxygen on the Moon involves substantial energy costs, estimated at about 24 kWh per kilogram. While this may seem manageable, the overall demand for fuel in future missions could escalate these costs significantly. The study also emphasizes the efficiency of using lunar fuel, noting that rockets launched from Earth require approximately 25 kg of propellant for every kilogram of payload, while those launched from the Moon only need about four kg. This efficiency makes lunar fuel production an attractive option for missions targeting locations deeper in the Solar System, as it reduces the energy required compared to launching from low-Earth orbit.</p></div></div>

This restriction, effective since Saturday, does not impact users who already have the app installed, and the service remains accessible via the web. PIPC officials noted that DeepSeek had 'partially neglected' its obligations, particularly regarding transparency in third-party data transfers and the collection of excessive personal information. In response, DeepSeek has sent a representative to South Korea to address these issues and ensure compliance. However, the duration of the app's unavailability remains uncertain, with PIPC indicating that resolving the identified privacy concerns may take considerable time. Additionally, Western information security experts have raised alarms about DeepSeek's security practices, highlighting that the app transmits unencrypted data to servers in China, controlled by ByteDance, and that sensitive customer data was found in an open database. Attempts to engage DeepSeek's AI model on sensitive topics yielded no responses.</p></div></div>

Despite two federal court orders mandating the resumption of these funds, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has called for a Department of Justice investigation into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, alleging it was designed to rush funding with reduced oversight. Environmental advocates argue that Zeldin's claims unfairly malign a program developed in collaboration with the Treasury Department. Critics suggest that the administration is shifting tactics by labeling specific programs as fraudulent to justify the funding freeze, although legal experts assert that courts require concrete evidence rather than broad allegations. They emphasize that challenges to funding must be based on specific instances of fraud or waste rather than sweeping accusations against entire programs.</p></div></div></div>

    <div class="original-title">Original title: iPhone 17 Lineup Rumored to Support Up to 35W Charging Speeds</div><div class="summary" id="summary-90f552282941d9480ead66123c1a17a2"><p>The iPhone 17 lineup, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, is rumored to support up to 35W wired charging speeds, which shows minimal improvement over the iPhone 16 models that already reached similar peak speeds. Analyst Jeff Pu from GF Securities noted that last year's iPhone 16 Pro models achieved maximum sustained charging speeds around 30W, with peak speeds reaching up to 38W under heavy loads. This suggests that users may not see a significant upgrade in charging capabilities with the new models. Additionally, there is no information yet on the wireless MagSafe charging speeds for the iPhone 17 series, while the iPhone 16 models support up to 25W. Other rumors surrounding Apple include potential design changes for the iPhone 17, enhancements for Siri in iOS 18.4, and the possibility of displaying ads in the Apple Maps app. Despite speculation about a product launch event, Apple may opt for a series of press releases to announce new devices.</p></div></div>

    <div class="original-title">Original title: iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Feature Aluminum Frame Instead of Titanium Frame</div><div class="summary" id="summary-0ea7393499da11e4bde294b214128cf7"><p>Apple is reportedly planning to revert to aluminum frames for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, as stated by supply chain analyst Jeff Pu. This change comes after the previous models utilized titanium frames, which contributed to a lighter design. The decision to use aluminum is linked to Apple's environmental goals, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030. Interestingly, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to retain a titanium frame, possibly due to a mix of materials that includes both titanium and aluminum. This shift in materials reflects Apple's broader strategy to promote sustainability in its product line. The upcoming iPhone 17 series is anticipated to be unveiled in September, with further details expected to emerge as the launch date approaches.</p></div></div>

Historically, the iPhone SE has struggled with resale value, losing significantly more value than higher-end models like the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 series. Previous SE models experienced rapid depreciation, with the third-generation losing 42.6% of its value in the first month and 57.8% after six months. In contrast, the iPhone 13 mini retained its value better, losing only 19.2% in the first month. The upcoming iPhone SE is expected to feature a modern design and upgraded specifications, which could positively impact its depreciation trend. The device may adopt an iPhone 14-style design and include a high-end chipset and camera system, potentially enhancing its competitiveness and long-term demand. Pricing will be crucial, with reports suggesting a starting price of up to $499, which could attract budget-conscious customers if justified by hardware improvements. The delay in launching the new SE has created a gap in Apple's lineup, possibly increasing demand for the new model if it offers substantial upgrades.</p></div></div>

This regulation mandates that developers provide contact information, including address, phone number, and email, for apps distributed in the EU. Apple had previously warned developers about the impending removal of non-compliant apps, effective February 17, 2025. Most developers were expected to have updated their apps to include this information, which can be submitted via App Store Connect. The DSA classifies any developer earning revenue from app sales or in-app purchases as a trader, necessitating the provision of contact details. Some independent developers and small companies expressed concerns over the requirement, citing difficulties in providing dedicated business contact information. The trader status information is displayed on the App Store product page for apps available in the EU's 27 member states.</p></div></div>

To restore minimized windows, users can highlight the app in the App Switcher and hold the Option key before releasing Command. Pressing the up or down arrow keys activates Exposé for the selected app, displaying all its windows, although this does not work in fullscreen mode. Additionally, users can drag files from Finder into the App Switcher to open them in the selected app. The App Switcher also allows users to hide windows by pressing H and quit apps quickly by highlighting an icon and pressing Q.

Despite this, the Netherlands stands out as a notable player, ranking fourth in the EU with 32 unicorns, 72% of which remain active. Most Dutch unicorns emerged between 2018 and 2022, with Amsterdam hosting 7% of all EU unicorns. The Netherlands has successfully attracted unicorns, with five startups relocating there, while only one has left for the US. However, the country still faces challenges, as it, like the rest of the EU, struggles to foster high-growth companies compared to the US. PwC identifies four key factors for the US's unicorn success: higher venture capital intensity, regulatory fragmentation in Europe, the size of the US market, and access to a larger talent pool. To bridge the unicorn gap, the EU is advised to enhance venture capital investment, streamline regulations, and create a more integrated market.</p></div></div>

    <div class="original-title">Original title: Why sustainability tech struggles to attract VC funding</div><div class="summary" id="summary-41c7ed23ac326e4d3145ce3170ba6f5d"><p>Sustainability technology has gained attention from investors and governments, with projections of $75 trillion in funding by 2050. However, venture capital investment in this sector has been declining since 2021, as many sustainability startups face challenges in securing funding. VCs often apply traditional growth metrics used for software and AI startups to sustainability companies, which may not yet demonstrate rapid growth or large markets. This mismatch in expectations leads to difficulties in financing, as many sustainability solutions require long sales cycles and significant upfront investments. The performance gap between impact investments and traditional VC returns creates tension within the VC model, making it risky for funds to back unproven sustainability innovations. To address these challenges, new funding mechanisms, actionable support for scaling, and adjusted evaluation metrics are necessary. Investors must adapt their approaches to align with the unique characteristics of sustainability technologies to avoid missing out on transformative innovations.</p></div></div>

Today, apps like Moises utilize AI to separate and remove instruments from songs, enabling musicians to play along with their favorite tracks without the original drums. Founded by Geraldo Ramos, Moises has gained significant popularity, boasting 50 million registered users, including notable musicians who praise its impact on their practice routines. The app employs machine learning algorithms trained on thousands of audio stems to effectively isolate and reconstruct sounds, enhancing the creative process for musicians. While AI tools like Moises are celebrated for democratizing music production, concerns about copyright infringement and the potential loss of human artistry persist. Some artists express both fascination and apprehension regarding AI's role in music, while others argue that technological advancements have historically coexisted with human creativity. Ultimately, the conversation around AI in music continues to evolve, with many hopeful about its potential to enhance rather than replace human artistry.</p></div></div>

This lack of funding is pushing early-stage companies to seek capital outside Europe, raising concerns about the continent's resilience to geopolitical and economic shocks. The report, 'The Importance of Climate Tech for European Resilience,' highlights that Europe has lost its early advantage in climate tech research and development, particularly noting Germany's stagnation in renewable capacity since 2012. The authors advocate for bold policy and investment shifts in energy, food security, frontier technologies, and raw materials, emphasizing the need for increased EU defense spending to at least 3% of GDP. Key recommendations include upgrading the energy grid, enhancing long-term energy storage, and supporting advanced technologies like AI and quantum computing. The report calls for €800 billion in annual spending through public-private partnerships and streamlined regulations to bolster resilience by 2029. As global political tensions rise, the need for European independence in venture financing becomes increasingly urgent.</p></div></div>

This news has led to a significant emotional response in Israel, where the family's abduction has symbolized the broader tragedy of the ongoing conflict. The announcement comes after the release of 19 living Israeli hostages, which had briefly raised hopes, but the confirmation of the Bibas family's deaths has left many distraught. Israeli officials have not confirmed the deaths but expressed grave concern for the family. In a potential exchange, Israel is expected to release Palestinian prisoners in return for the bodies. The Bibas family’s ordeal has become a focal point for both those advocating for negotiations to end the war and those calling for continued military action against Hamas.</p></div></div>

Initially diagnosed with a polymicrobial infection, his condition has been described as complex, requiring modified treatment. The infection developed alongside bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, necessitating cortisone antibiotic therapy. A recent CT scan revealed bilateral pneumonia, prompting additional drug therapy. Despite his health challenges, the 88-year-old pope remains in good spirits and appreciates the prayers for his recovery. He has delegated a prelate to attend a Mass on his behalf this weekend, as he will not participate in scheduled events. This marks the fourth hospitalization for Francis, who has faced various health issues in recent years, including surgeries and respiratory infections. His medical history includes the removal of the upper lobe of his right lung, making him susceptible to respiratory illnesses, particularly during winter months.</p></div></div>

The recent decision to negotiate a peace settlement without involving Ukraine or European nations has left leaders in Berlin, London, and Paris feeling unsettled and forced to reconsider their military strategies. Discussions are underway about potentially deploying tens of thousands of troops as peacekeepers, which would require significant increases in military budgets, reminiscent of Cold War levels. While public support for Ukraine remains strong, the prospect of committing troops poses a risk to domestic political stability. French President Emmanuel Macron's earlier proposal for a peacekeeping force has faced skepticism, especially following his weakened political position after recent elections. Experts emphasize that Europe must prepare to take on greater responsibilities in this evolving geopolitical landscape.</p></div></div>

The United Nations confirmed the troop pullout, but concerns remain regarding the fragile truce established after the recent conflict.

However, Israel's military spokesman indicated that troops would remain at five strategic locations until the Lebanese military could fully implement the agreement. Accusations have been exchanged, with Israeli officials claiming Hezbollah and the Lebanese army have not upheld their end of the deal, while the Lebanese military asserts it cannot deploy fully until Israel withdraws completely.</p></div></div>

Zelenskyy emphasized that 58% of Ukrainians trust him, countering Trump's claims about his popularity. He expressed concern over misinformation affecting perceptions of Ukraine's situation and stated that any discussions about security guarantees must involve NATO or strengthening Ukraine's military. Zelenskyy rejected the notion of a mineral exploration deal with the US without security guarantees, labeling it as unserious. He criticized the US for softening the language around Russia's invasion, insisting it is a war, not merely a conflict. Furthermore, he highlighted the need for Europe to prepare for potential reductions in US support and mentioned ongoing discussions with various nations for security cooperation. Zelenskyy also noted that Russian officials are exploiting Trump's false claims to undermine his legitimacy and sow discord within Ukraine.</p></div></div>

    <div class="original-title">Original title: UK inflation rises to 3% in January, hitting workers’ wages and interest rate cut hopes</div><div class="summary" id="summary-5d81a4621c3e2cc314693e07824d4646"><p>UK inflation accelerated to 3% in January, surpassing economists' expectations of 2.8%, primarily driven by increased food costs and higher private school fees following the removal of a VAT exemption. This rise in inflation has diminished the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England, with market expectations dropping from 24% to 15% for a cut in March. Despite this, investors still anticipate two additional rate cuts later in the year after a recent reduction to 4.5%. The chancellor is concerned that rising inflation may lead public sector workers to demand higher wage increases than the agreed 2.8%. While earnings growth was reported at 6% in December, real disposable incomes are expected to be squeezed as inflation rises. The British Chambers of Commerce highlighted the significant cost burdens businesses face, which could further fuel inflation. However, some analysts believe the inflation spike may be temporary, attributing it to base effects and predicting a decline in the coming months.</p></div></div>

The research indicates that this group, characterized as young, highly educated, and socially leftwing, often imposes purity tests on potential allies and overestimates public support for their views. For instance, they believe that 35% of the public supports abolishing the monarchy, while the actual figure is only 18%. The report highlights that progressive activists' tendency to criticize and misunderstand other voters contributes to the challenges faced by progressive campaigns and the rise of far-right sentiments. The authors suggest that a more inclusive and persuasive approach is necessary for the liberal left to regain influence, emphasizing the importance of engaging with the broader public rather than expecting immediate agreement on social change.</p></div></div>

The WTA confirmed that the individual was ejected from the venue and will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment. Raducanu, visibly upset, managed to recover from a poor start to take the first set to a tie-break but ultimately lost 7-6 (6), 6-4. Despite her efforts, including breaking back twice in the first set, she could not convert break points in the second set. Meanwhile, Coco Gauff was also eliminated by McCartney Kessler, who achieved her first win against a top 10 player. In contrast, top-ranked players Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek advanced easily in their matches. The tournament faced rain delays, affecting match schedules, but Raducanu and fellow British player Katie Boulter are set to compete in the upcoming HSBC Championships in London.</p></div></div>

Research indicates that the average annual growth in life expectancy dropped from 0.23 years (1990-2011) to 0.15 years (2011-2019), with every country except Norway showing a decrease. England's decline was particularly stark, falling from 0.25 to 0.07 years. Contributing factors include poor diet, inactivity, and rising obesity rates, particularly affecting cardiovascular health and cancer outcomes. The Covid pandemic further exacerbated these issues, leading to declines in life expectancy in many countries. Countries like Norway, Iceland, and Sweden maintained or improved their life expectancy by effectively addressing health risks through government policies. Experts emphasize the need for stronger actions to combat obesity and promote physical activity, highlighting that the current trends are long-standing and require systemic changes rather than quick fixes. The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledges the challenges faced by the NHS and is focusing on preventive measures in its upcoming health plan.</p></div></div>

The case stemmed from a 2021 incident where Rocky allegedly shot at former friend A$AP Relli during an altercation outside a Hollywood hotel. Relli testified that Rocky fired two shots, grazing his knuckles, while Rocky's defense argued that he used a prop gun for security reasons. The defense portrayed Relli as a jealous opportunist seeking financial gain, citing recorded messages where Relli discussed suing Rocky. Witnesses, including another member of the A$AP Mob, testified that Rocky fired blanks as a warning. The trial concluded without Rocky taking the stand, and jurors were shown video evidence of the incident. Despite the prosecution's claims, no gun was presented as evidence, and the defense's assertion that the gun was fake was only made at the trial's start. After the verdict, Rocky expressed gratitude to the jurors, stating, 'Thank y’all for saving my life.'</p></div></div>

The study emphasizes the concept of the 'exposome,' which encompasses various environmental exposures throughout life, such as living conditions and lifestyle choices. The researchers identified 85 environmental exposures linked to premature death, narrowing it down to 25 that also correlate with biological aging. Notably, 23 of these exposures are modifiable, suggesting potential avenues for improving public health. While age and sex account for about half of the variation in death risk, environmental factors contribute an additional 17%, whereas genetic predisposition accounts for less than 2%. The findings highlight that while environmental factors are crucial for diseases like lung and heart conditions, genetics may play a more significant role in diseases such as breast cancer and dementia. Despite its insights, the study acknowledges limitations, including the potential variability of results in different populations and the need for further research to establish causal relationships.</p></div></div>

Friedrich Merz, leader of the CDU/CSU alliance, is currently leading in polls with nearly 30% support, making the chancellorship a significant opportunity for him. The CDU has committed to a firewall policy against forming alliances with the far-right AfD, but this stance has been tested during the campaign, particularly when Merz attempted to pass a motion with AfD backing, which ultimately failed due to internal party dissent. Potential coalition scenarios include partnerships with the Greens or a grand coalition with the Social Democrats. However, the anticipated strong showing for the AfD could complicate coalition stability, especially if the CDU continues to seek support from AfD voters. Excluding the AfD from coalition discussions may also fuel perceptions of elitism and populism in the political landscape.</p></div></div>

The escape clause, proposed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, aims to allow EU member states to increase defence spending beyond the usual fiscal rules, which could help countries like Italy, struggling with high public debt and low growth. However, some experts question whether this clause will significantly boost spending, as many states are already breaching EU debt rules. In contrast, joint defence bonds could potentially raise more funds, although Germany has historically opposed such measures. The pandemic broke the taboo on EU joint borrowing, leading to discussions about a new facility for defence financing. The idea of a special vehicle for issuing bonds, which could include the UK, is also on the table. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock hinted at a substantial financial package for European security, indicating a shift in urgency regarding defence funding discussions.</p></div></div>

Despite her dedication, the Taliban's crackdown on media led to her dismissal from her job due to gender-based threats against her employers. The media landscape in Afghanistan has drastically shrunk since the takeover, with a significant decline in female journalists, dropping from 2,833 to only 600 by March 2024. The Taliban's restrictions have included a nationwide ban on women's voices in public and the closure of female-run media outlets like Radio Begum, which aimed to provide educational services for women. Alia expressed deep despair over the loss of progress for women and the stifling of their voices, emphasizing the importance of media in exposing the Taliban's actions and keeping the public informed. Despite the challenges, some female voices persist in northern provinces, highlighting the ongoing struggle for women's representation in Afghan media.</p></div></div>

    <div class="original-title">Original title: Cane corso: the new ‘status dog’ linked to rising attacks as XL bully ban takes effect</div><div class="summary" id="summary-2fc08919b1dd98b527fb2633bea3c842"><p>A recent dog attack in Sheffield involving a cane corso has raised concerns about the breed's growing popularity as a status symbol, particularly following the ban on XL bullies under the Dangerous Dogs Act. The incident left a 47-year-old man injured and highlighted a troubling trend, as reports indicate a 21% increase in dog attacks in England and Wales from 2022 to 2023. Experts warn that while responsible ownership can lead to well-behaved dogs, many cane corsos are raised in chaotic environments, leading to aggression. The breed, originally bred for guarding and herding, has a powerful bite and can weigh up to 50kg, making them potentially dangerous in the wrong hands. Recent attacks involving cane corsos have resulted in severe injuries, prompting calls for better regulation of dog ownership and breeding practices. Some argue that banning specific breeds is ineffective, as it merely shifts the focus to other breeds. Advocates for responsible ownership emphasize the need for licensing and training requirements for large dog breeds to prevent future incidents.</p></div></div>

But I’ve learned to appreciate my husband more after a New Year’s party</div><div class="summary" id="summary-23b15b61aa463cd50f3ccc0fe0dbf7d7"><p>A woman reflects on her 17-year marriage after attending a New Year's Eve party where she conversed with single women who shared their disappointing experiences with dating apps. Despite feeling comfortable and slightly complacent in her own marriage, she realized how much she had taken her husband for granted. The stories from the single women reminded her of her own past struggles with finding a partner and renewed her appreciation for her husband, who, while not perfect, makes her laugh and supports her. She acknowledges the importance of putting effort into their relationship, such as turning off the television and prioritizing quality time together. The couple has also arranged babysitting swaps with friends to enjoy regular date nights, emphasizing the value of nurturing their bond and recognizing the beauty in their long-term partnership.</p></div></div></div>
